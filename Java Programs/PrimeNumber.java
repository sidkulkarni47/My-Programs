/*
 * Problem Statement: How to find if the given number is prime or not?
 * I am given a number eg 53.
 * A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
 * 2 is the only even prime number.
 * I will first check if the number is 2 If it is then it's prime.
 * If the number is greater than 2 and is even, then it is not a prime number.
 * For odd numbers greater than 2 I will check divisibility by all numbers from 3 up to the square root of the given number.
 * If the number is divisible by any of these then it is not a prime number otherwise, it is prime.
